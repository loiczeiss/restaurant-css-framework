# restaurant-css-framework

Hi, I'm Lo√Øc Zeiss, an apprentice webdeveloper in Belgium.
Im currently working on the project "restaurant-css-framework" where I experiment
bootstrap use. To do so, I made a site describing a restaurant in a few pages that cover
a home, menu, gallery, contact and locations page. I'm mostly using HTML and trying to use the least css possible to 
use fully the bootstrap "way" and get my head around it.
I invite you to discover what i've done on "https://loiczeiss.github.io/restaurant-css-framework/"
I hope you'll enjoy it!
